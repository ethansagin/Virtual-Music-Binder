VIRTUAL MUSIC FOLDER README
Welcome to the Virtual Music Folder, my second portfolio project for the Flatiron School Online Web Dev Program! This program is meant to demonstrate what I've learned about using ORMs, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra.

The project is a web version of a music binder, geared towards classical musicians, which can store sheet music and information about a piece in various folders. This app could be used in an audition, rehearsal, or performance environment. To use, follow the onscreen prompts to create an account and start filling your binder.

INSTALLATION

gem install Virtual-Music-Binder(???)
